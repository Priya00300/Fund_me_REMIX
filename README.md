INTRODUCTION


The "FundMe" smart contract is a decentralized fundraising contract written in Solidity.The contract employs Chainlink's decentralized oracles to fetch real-time price data, enabling a minimum funding threshold in USD. Additionally, the contract includes a withdrawal function accessible only by the contract owner.


TECH STACK USED:

1.Solidity: The primary programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.

2.Chainlink: Integration with Chainlink's AggregatorV3Interface to obtain accurate and up-to-date price data for Ethereum-to-USD conversion.

3.Ethereum: The blockchain platform where the smart contract is deployed and executed.

4.Remix IDE: An online Integrated Development Environment for Ethereum smart contracts.

ABOUT THE TEST-NET USED:

The test-net used is Sapolia,we can use another test-net if we change the ETH/USD Adress inside the PriceConverter.sol file.
Thank you.
